# To Do Example

I used firebase as backend in the project. On the frontend, I preferred Typescript React. I provided the global variables in the project and control of these variables with redux and redux-saga. Also, on the UI side, I preferred the Material UI library. Also, I used some minor libraries. These are included in the package.json file.
